0,Category,Definition and interpretation
1,Below optimum,• Indicates that the nutrient is probably deficient and that the deficiency will likely limit crop growth • High probability of a profitable return from correcting a low level. • Recommendations for a soil testing 'below optimum' are designed to gradually build up the nutrient level to optimum and to maintain it at that level.
2,Optimum,"• Indicates that the nutrient is probably adequate and will likely not limit crop growth in a typical growing season. • There is a low probability of a profitable return from increasing the soil test level above optimum. • Recommendations for a soil testing 'optimum' are designed to offset crop removal in order to maintain the nutrient in the optimum range. • If you are soil testing on an annual basis, no maintenance fertilizer is needed when the soil tests in the optimum range."
3,Above optimum,"• Indicates that the nutrient is more than adequate and will not limit crop growth. • Very low probability of a profitable return from applying additional nutrients to a soil test- ing 'above optimum.' • No fertilizer is recommended on these soils. Too much of a plant nutrient may cause a nu- trient imbalance in the soil and, as a result, in the plant, which may adversely affect plant growth and environmental quality."
