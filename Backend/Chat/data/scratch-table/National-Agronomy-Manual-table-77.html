Avoid spraying in tempera- tures above 90º F.</td></tr><tr><td>Application timing-rain</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>Reduces exposure-delaying application when signif- icant rainfall events are forecast that could produce substantial leaching or runoff can reduce pesticide transport to ground and surface water.</td></tr><tr><td>Application timing- relative humidity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td><td>Reduces exposure-spraying when there is higher relative humidity reduces evaporation of water from spray droplets thus reducing drift losses.</td></tr><tr><td>Application timing- wind</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>10</td><td>Reduces exposure-delaying application when wind speed is not optimal can reduce pesticide drift. Opti- mal spray conditions for reducing drift occur when the air is slightly unstable with a very mild steady wind between 2 and 9 mph.</td></tr><tr><td>Formulations and adju- vants 2,3</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>Reduces exposure-specific pesticide formulations and/or adjuvants can increase efficacy and allow lower application rates, drift retardant adjuvants can reduce pesticide spray drift.</td></tr><tr><td>Monitoring plus econom- ic pest thresholds.</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>Reduces exposure-reduces the amount of pesticide applied with preventative treatments because ap- plications are based on monitoring that determines when a pest population exceeds a previously deter- mined economic threshold.</td></tr><tr><td>Partial treatment</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>Reduces exposure-spot treatment, banding and di- rected spraying reduces amount of pesticide applied. Assumes less than 50% of the area is treated.</td></tr><tr><td>Precision application using smart sprayers</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>Reduces exposure-using Smart Sprayer technology (i.e. green sensors, sonar-based sensors, GPS-based variable rate application, computer controlled spray nozzles, etc.) can substantially reduce the amount of pesticide applied.</td></tr><tr><td>Set-backs</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>Reduces exposure-reduces overall amount of pesti- cide applied, reduces offsite pesticide drift. Assumes that the set-backs with no application are at least 30 feet wide.</td></tr><tr><td>Soil incorporation 2,3</td><td></td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>Reduces exposure-reduces solution and adsorbed runoff losses, but potentially increases leaching losses, especially for low K OC pesticides. Applicable to shallow mechanical or irrigation incorporation. Not applicable if pesticide leaching to groundwater is an identified natural resource concern. Not appli- cable if soil erosion is not adequately managed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
