0,Conservation Crop Rotation (Code 328),"• Reduce erosion from wind and water • Maintain or improve soil organic matter content • Manage the balance of plant nutrients • Improve water use efficiency • Manage saline seeps • Manage plant pests (weeds, insects, and diseases) • Provide food for domestic livestock • Provide food and cover for wildlife • Provide energy use",• water erosion → m-su • wind erosion → m-su • soil quality → sl-m • water quality → sl - su • water quant. → sl-m • air quality → sl-m • plant health → m-su • water erosion → sl-m • conservation → sl -m
1,Contour Buffer Strips (Code 332),• Reduce sheet and rill erosion • Reduce transport of sediment and other water-borne contaminants • Increase water infiltration,• wind erosion → n/a • soil quality → sl-m • water quality → sl - su • water quant. → sl • air qual. & plt. health → sl • energy conservation → sl-m
2,Contour Farming (Code 330),"• Reduce sheet and rill erosion • Reduce transport of sediment, other solids and attached contaminants • Increase water infiltration",• wind erosion → n/a • soil quality → sl-m • water quality → sl - su • water quant. → sl • air qual. & plt. health → sl
3,Cover Crop (Code 340),• Reduce erosion from wind and water • Increase soil organic matter content • Capture and recycle or redistribute nutrients in the soil profile • Promote biological nitrogen fixation • Increase biodiversity; Provide weed suppression • Provide supplemental forage; Manage soil moisture • Reduce particulate emissions into the atmosphere • Minimize and reduce soil compaction • Reduce energy use,• water erosion → m-su • wind erosion → m-su • soil quality → sl-m • water quality → sl-m • water quant. → sl-m • air quality → sl-m • plant health → sl-m • energy conservation → sl-m
4,Field Border (Code 386),• Reduce erosion from wind and water • Protect soil and water quality • Manage pest populations • Provide wildlife food and cover • Increase carbon storage • Improve air quality,• Water & wind er → sl - su • soil quality → sl - su * • water quality → sl-m • water quant. → sl-m • air quality → n/a - sl • plant health → su 2/
5,Filter Strips (Code 393),• Reduce suspended solids and associated contaminants in runoff • Reduce dissolved contaminant loadings in runoff • Reduce suspended solids and associated contaminants in irrigation tail water,• Water & wind er → n/a • soil quality → su 2/ • water quality → sl - su
