0,Herbaceous Wind Barriers (1003),,,5 3/,5,"Reduces wind erosion, traps adsorbed pesti- cides, can provide habitat for beneficial insects which reduces the need for pesticides, can provide habitat to congregate pests which can result in reduced pesticide application, and can reduce pesticide drift to surface water."
1,"Irrigation System, Microir- rigation (441)",10,15,15,,Reduces exposure potential - efficient and uniform irrigation reduces pesticide transport to ground and surface water.
2,"Irrigation System, Sprinkler (442)",10,10,10,,Reduces exposure potential - efficient and uniform irrigation reduces pesticide transport to ground and surface water.
3,"Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface (443)",5,5,5,,Reduces exposure potential - efficient and uniform irrigation reduces pesticide transport to ground and surface water.
4,Irrigation System Tail Water Recovery (447),,15,15,,Captures pesticide residues and facilitates their degradation.
5,Irrigation Water Manage- ment (449),15,15,15,,"Reduces exposure potential - water is applied at rates that minimize pesticide transport to ground and surface water, promotes healthy plants which can better tolerate pests."
6,Mulching (484) with natural materials,10,10,10,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, reduces the need for pesticides."
7,Mulching (484) with plastic,10,5,5,,Reduces the need for pesticides. Not applicable if erosion and pesticide runoff from non- mulched areas is not adequately managed.
8,"Residue Management, No- till and Strip-Till (329)",5,10,15,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, builds soil organic matter. Assumes at least 60% ground cover at the time of application."
9,"Residue Management, Mulch-Till (345)",5,5,10,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, builds soil organic matter. Assumes at least 30% ground cover at the time of application."
10,"Residue Management, Ridge Till (346)",5,5,10,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, builds soil organic matter."
11,Riparian Forest Buffer (391),5,15,15,10,"Increases infiltration and uptake of subsurface water, traps sediment, builds soil organic mat- ter, and reduces pesticide drift. This assumes 30 foot minimum width."
12,Riparian Herbaceous Cover (390),5,10,10,5,"Increases infiltration, traps sediment, builds soil organic matter, and reduces pesticide drift. This assumes 30 foot minimum width."
