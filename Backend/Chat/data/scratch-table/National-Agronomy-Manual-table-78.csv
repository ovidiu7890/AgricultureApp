0,"Spray nozzle selection, maintenance and opera- tion.",,,,10,"Reduces exposure-selecting appropriate nozzle and pressure for the application, with an emphasis on higher volume spray nozzles run at lower pressures, will produce larger droplets and a narrower droplet size distribution, which reduces spray drift. Proper nozzle spacing, boom height, and boom suspension, along with frequent calibration and replacement of worn nozzles and leaking tubing, can increase effi- cacy and reduce drift potential."
1,"Substitution-cultural, mechanical or biological controls",15,15,15,15,"Reduces risk-substituting alternative cultural, mechanical or biological pest suppression techniques to reduce the application of a pesticide that poses a hazard to an identified natural resource concern. Not applicable if hazards from alternative suppression techniques are not adequately managed."
2,"Substitution-lower risk pesticides 2,3",15,15,15,15,Reduces risk-substituting an alternative lower risk pesticide to reduce the application of a pesticide that poses a hazard to an identified natural resource con- cern. Not applicable if the alternative pesticide is not explicitly recommended by extension or an appropri- ately certified crop consultant because NRCS cannot make pesticide recommendations.
3,Substitution-semio- chemicals,15,15,15,15,"Reduces risk-using semiochemicals (e.g., mating disrupting pheromones) to decrease reproductive success or control population density/location to reduce pesticide applications."
