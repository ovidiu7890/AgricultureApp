Not applicable if pesticide leaching to groundwater is an identified natural resource concern.</td></tr><tr><td>Dike (356)</td><td></td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>Reduces exposure potential - excludes out- side water or captures pesticide residues and facilitates their degradation. Not applicable if pesticide leaching to groundwater is an identi- fied natural resource concern.</td></tr><tr><td>Drainage Water Manage- ment (554)</td><td></td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>Drainage during the growing season increases infiltration and aerobic pesticide degradation in the rootzone and reduces storm water runoff. Managed drainage mode when the field is not being cropped reduces discharge of pesticide residues from the previous growing season. Seasonal saturation may reduce the need for pesticides. Not applicable if pesticide leach- ing to groundwater is an identified natural resource concern.</td></tr><tr><td>Field Border (386)</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>Increases infiltration and traps adsorbed pesti- cides, often reduces application area resulting in less pesticide applied, can provide habitat for beneficial insects which reduces the need for pesticides, can provide habitat to congre- gate pests which can result in reduced pesti- cide application, also can reduce inadvertent pesticide application and drift to surface water. Assumes 20 foot minimum width.</td></tr><tr><td>Filter Strip (393)</td><td></td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>Increases infiltration and traps adsorbed pesti- cides, often reduces application area resulting in less pesticide applied, can provide habitat for beneficial insects which reduces the need for pesticides, can provide habitat to congre- gate pests which can result in reduced pesti- cide application, also can reduce inadvertent pesticide application and drift to surface water. Assumes 30 foot minimum width.</td></tr><tr><td>Forage Harvest Manage- ment (511)</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>Reduces exposure potential - timely harvesting reduces the need for pesticides.</td></tr><tr><td>Hedgerow Planting (442)</td><td></td><td></td><td>10 3/</td><td>10</td><td>Reduces adsorbed pesticide deposition in sur- face water, also can reduce inadvertent pesti- cide application and drift to surface water</td></tr></tbody></table>
