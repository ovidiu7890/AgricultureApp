,Essential element,Mobility,Deficiency symptoms and occurrence
0,Boron,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves and the growing point show symptoms first,"• Reduced leaf size and deformation of new leaves • Interveinal chlorosis if deficiency is severe deficiency • May cause distorted branches and stems • Related to flower and or fruit abortion, poor grain fill, and stunt- ed growth • May occur on very acid, sandy-textured soils or alkaline soils."
1,Copper,Not mobile within plants: upper,"• Reduced leaf size leaves and the growing point show • Uniformly pale yellow leaves deficiency symptoms first • Leaves may lack turgor and may develop a bluish-green cast, become chlorotic and curl • Flower production fails to take place • Organic soils are most likely to be Cu deficient"
2,Iron,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first,"• Interveinal chlorosis that progresses over the entire leaf • With severe deficiencies, leaves turn entirely white • Factors contributing to Fe deficiency include imbalance with other metals, excessive soil phosphorus levels, high soil pH, wet, and cold soils"
3,Manganese,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first,• Interveinal chlorosis • Appearance of brownish-black specks • Occurs most often on high organic matter soils and soils with neutral to alkaline pH with low native Mn content
4,Zinc,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves and the growing point show deficiency symptoms first,• Shortened internodes between new leaves • Death of meristematic tissue • Deformed new leaves • Interveinal chlorosis • Occurs most often on alkaline (high pH) soils or soils with high available phosphorus levels
5,Molybdenum,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first,"• Interveinal chlorosis • Wilting • Marginal necrosis of upper leaves • Occurs principally on very acid soils, since Mo becomes less available with low pH"
6,Chlorine,"Mobile within plant, but defi- ciency usually appear on the upper leaves first",• Chlorosis in upper leaves symptoms • Overall wilting of the plants • Deficiencies may occur in well drained soils under high rainfall conditions
7,Cobalt,Used by symbiotic N-fixing bac- teria in root nodules of legumes and other plants,• Causes nitrogen deficiency: chlorotic leaves and stunted plants • Occurs in areas with soils deficient in native Colorado
8,Nickel,Mobile within plants,• Symptoms and occurrence are not well documented but may in- clude chlorosis and necrosis in young leaves and failure to pro- duce viable seeds
