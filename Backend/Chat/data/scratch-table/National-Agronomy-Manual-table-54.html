Temporarily decreases biological activity. Reduces pathogen density and attractiveness of the material to vectors.</td><td>High pH immobilizes met- als as long as pH levels are maintained.</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Drying</td><td>Drying of biosolids by increasing temperature of solids during waste-</td><td>Destroys pathogens, eliminates most of water.</td><td>Greatly reduces sludge volume.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>water treatment.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Chemical and physical processes that enhance the handling of stabilized biosolids</td></tr><tr><td>Conditioning</td><td>Processes that cause biosolids to coagulate to aid in the separation of water.</td><td>Improves sludge dewatering char- acteristics. May increase dry solids mass and improve stabilization.</td><td>The ease of spreading may be reduced by treating bio- solids with polymers.</td></tr><tr><td>Dewatering</td><td>High force separation of water and solids. Methods include vacuum filters, centrifuges, filter and belt presses, etc.</td><td>Increase solids concentration to 15 to 45 %. Lowers N and K concentra- tions. Improves ease of handling.</td><td>Reduces land requirements and lowers transportation costs.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Advanced stabilization method</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Composting</td><td>Aerobic, thermophilic, biological sta- bilization in a windrow, aerated static pile, or vessel.</td><td>Lowers biological activity, destroys most pathogens, and degrades sludge to humus-like material.</td><td>Excellent soil conditioning properties. Contains less plant available nitrogen than other biosolids.</td></tr></tbody></table>
