0,Application timing- ambient temperature,,,,5,"Reduces exposure-spraying during cooler tempera- tures (e.g. early morning, evening or at night) can help reduce drift losses. Avoid spraying in tempera- tures above 90º F."
1,Application timing-rain,15,15,15,,Reduces exposure-delaying application when signif- icant rainfall events are forecast that could produce substantial leaching or runoff can reduce pesticide transport to ground and surface water.
2,Application timing- relative humidity,,,,5,Reduces exposure-spraying when there is higher relative humidity reduces evaporation of water from spray droplets thus reducing drift losses.
3,Application timing- wind,,,,10,Reduces exposure-delaying application when wind speed is not optimal can reduce pesticide drift. Opti- mal spray conditions for reducing drift occur when the air is slightly unstable with a very mild steady wind between 2 and 9 mph.
4,"Formulations and adju- vants 2,3",5,5,5,5,"Reduces exposure-specific pesticide formulations and/or adjuvants can increase efficacy and allow lower application rates, drift retardant adjuvants can reduce pesticide spray drift."
5,Monitoring plus econom- ic pest thresholds.,15,15,15,15,Reduces exposure-reduces the amount of pesticide applied with preventative treatments because ap- plications are based on monitoring that determines when a pest population exceeds a previously deter- mined economic threshold.
6,Partial treatment,15,15,15,10,"Reduces exposure-spot treatment, banding and di- rected spraying reduces amount of pesticide applied. Assumes less than 50% of the area is treated."
7,Precision application using smart sprayers,10,10,10,10,"Reduces exposure-using Smart Sprayer technology (i.e. green sensors, sonar-based sensors, GPS-based variable rate application, computer controlled spray nozzles, etc.) can substantially reduce the amount of pesticide applied."
8,Set-backs,5,5,5,10,"Reduces exposure-reduces overall amount of pesti- cide applied, reduces offsite pesticide drift. Assumes that the set-backs with no application are at least 30 feet wide."
9,"Soil incorporation 2,3",,15,15,,"Reduces exposure-reduces solution and adsorbed runoff losses, but potentially increases leaching losses, especially for low K OC pesticides. Applicable to shallow mechanical or irrigation incorporation. Not applicable if pesticide leaching to groundwater is an identified natural resource concern. Not appli- cable if soil erosion is not adequately managed."
