0,Alley Cropping (311),5,5,10,10,"Increases infiltration and uptake of subsurface water, reduces soil erosion, can provide habitat for beneficial insects which can reduce the need for pesticides, also can reduce pesticide drift to surface water."
1,Anionic Polyacrylamide (PAM) Erosion Control (450),,5,15,,"Increases infiltration and deep percolation, reduces soil erosion."
2,Bedding (310),5,5,5,,Increases surface infiltration and aerobic pesti- cide degradation in the rootzone.
3,Conservation Cover (327),10,10,10,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, and builds soil organic matter In perennial cropping systems such as orchards, vineyards, berries and nursery stock."
4,Conservation Crop Rotation (328),10,10,10,,Reduces the need for pesticides by breaking pest lifecycles. The rotation shall consist of at least 2 crops in the rotation and no crop grown more than once before growing a different crop.
5,Constructed Wetland (656),5,5,10,,Captures pesticide residues and facilitates their degradation.
6,Contour Buffer Strips (332),,10,10,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion."
7,Contour Farming (330),,5,5,,"Increases infiltration and deep percolation, reduces soil erosion."
8,Contour Orchard and Other Fruit Area (331),,5,5,,"Increases infiltration and deep percolation, reduces soil erosion."
9,Cover Crop (340) that is incorporated into the soil.,5,5,5,,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, builds soil organic matter. Assumes at least 4000 lbs/ac of live biomass at the time of till- age."
10,Cover Crop (340) for weed suppression that is mulch tilled or no-tilled into for the next crop.,10,10,10,10,"Increases infiltration, reduces soil erosion, builds soil organic matter. Assumes at least 4000 lbs/ac of live biomass at the time of tillage and at least 30% ground cover at the time of the pesticide application."
11,Cross Wind Ridges (588),,,5 3/,,Reduces wind erosion and adsorbed pesticide deposition in surface water. Assumes the pes- ticide is applied while the field is in the ridged state.
12,Cross Wind Trap Strips (589C),,,10 3/,,"Reduces wind erosion and adsorbed pesticide deposition in surface water, traps adsorbed pesticides."
