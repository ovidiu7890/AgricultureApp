,Crop,Critical period,Comments
0,Alfalfa,"At seedling stage for new seedlings, just after cutting for hay, and at start of flowering stage for seed production","Any moisture stress during growth period reduces yield Soil moisture is generally reduced immediately before and during cutting, drying, and hay collecting"
1,"Beans, dry",Flowering through pod formation,
2,Broccoli,During head formation and enlargement,
3,Cabbage,During head formation and enlargement,
4,Cauliflower,During entire growing season,
5,Cane berries,Blossom through harvest,
6,Citrus,During entire growing season,Blossom and next season fruit set occurs during harvest of the previous crop
7,"Corn, grain",From tasseling through silk stage and kernels become firm,Needs adequate moisture from germination until kernel dent stage for maximum production. Depletion of 80% or more of AWC can occur during final ripening period without impacting yield
8,"Corn, silage",From tasseling through silk stage and kernels become firm,Needs adequate moisture from germination until kernel dent stage for maximum production
9,"Corn, sweet",From tasseling through silk stage and until ker- nels become firm,
10,Cotton,First blossom through boll maturing stage,"Any moisture stress, even temporary, ceases blossom formation and boll set for at least 15 days after moisture again becomes available"
11,Cranberries,Blossom through fruit sizing,
12,Fruit trees,"During the initiation and early development period of flower buds, the flowering and fruit setting period (may be the previous year), the fruit growing and enlarging period, and the pre- harvest period",Stone fruits are especially sensitive to moisture stress during last two weeks before harvest
13,"Grain, small","During boot, bloom, milk stage, early head de- velopment and early ripening stages",Critical period for malting barley is at soft dough stage to maintain a quality kernel
14,Grapes,"All growth periods, especially during fruit filling",See vine crops
15,Peanuts,Full Season,
16,Lettuce,Head enlargement to harvest,Water shortage results in a sour and strong lettuce
17,Melons,Blossom through harvest,
18,Milo,"Secondary rooting and tillering to boot stage, heading, flowering, and grain formation through filling",
19,"Onions, dry","During bulb formation, near harvest",
20,"Onions, green",Blossom through harvest stress,Strong and hot onions can result from moisture
21,Nut trees,"During flower initiation period, fruit set, and mid-season growth",Pre-harvest period is not critical because nuts form during mid-season period
22,Pasture,During establishment and boot stage to head formation,
