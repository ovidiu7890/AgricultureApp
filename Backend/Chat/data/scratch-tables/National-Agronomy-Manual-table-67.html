<table><tbody><tr><th>Table 503-41</th><th>Example of definitions for soil test interpretation categories (from the Penn State Soil Testing Program for Agronomic Crops)</th></tr><tr><td>Category</td><td>Definition and interpretation</td></tr><tr><td>Below optimum</td><td>• Indicates that the nutrient is probably deficient and that the deficiency will likely limit crop growth • High probability of a profitable return from correcting a low level. • Recommendations for a soil testing &#x27;below optimum&#x27; are designed to gradually build up the nutrient level to optimum and to maintain it at that level.</td></tr><tr><td>Optimum</td><td>• Indicates that the nutrient is probably adequate and will likely not limit crop growth in a typical growing season. • There is a low probability of a profitable return from increasing the soil test level above optimum. • Recommendations for a soil testing &#x27;optimum&#x27; are designed to offset crop removal in order to maintain the nutrient in the optimum range. • If you are soil testing on an annual basis, no maintenance fertilizer is needed when the soil tests in the optimum range.</td></tr><tr><td>Above optimum</td><td>• Indicates that the nutrient is more than adequate and will not limit crop growth. • Very low probability of a profitable return from applying additional nutrients to a soil test- ing &#x27;above optimum.&#x27; • No fertilizer is recommended on these soils. Too much of a plant nutrient may cause a nu- trient imbalance in the soil and, as a result, in the plant, which may adversely affect plant growth and environmental quality.</td></tr></tbody></table>
