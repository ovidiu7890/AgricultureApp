,Essential element,Function in plant
0,Calcium,• Essential for cell elongation and division • Specifically required for: -root and leaf development -function and cell membranes -formation of cell wall compounds • Involved in the activation of several plant enzymes
1,Magnesium,"• Primary component of chlorophyll and is therefore actively involved in photosynthesis • Structural component of ribosomes, which are required for protein synthesis • Involved in phosphate metabolism, respiration, and the activation of several enzyme systems"
2,Sulfur,"• Required for the synthesis of the sulfur-containing amino acids cystine, cysteine, and methionine, which are essential for protein forma- tion • Involved with: -development of enzymes and vitamins -promotion of nodulation for nitrogen fixation by legumes -seed production chlorophyll formation -formation of several organic compounds that give characteristic odors to garlic, mustard, and onion"
3,Boron,"• Essential for: -germination of pollen grains and growth of pollen tubes -seed and cell wall formation -development and growth of new cells in meristematic tissue • Forms sugar/borate complexes associated with the translocation of sugars, starches, N, and P • Important in protein synthesis"
4,Copper,• Necessary for chlorophyll formation • Catalyzes several enzymes
5,Iron,"• Serves as a catalyst in chlorophyll synthesis -development of enzymes and vitamins -promotion of nodulation for nitrogen fixation by legumes -seed production chlorophyll formation -formation of several organic compounds that give characteristic odors to garlic, mustard, and onion"
6,Boron,"• Essential for: -germination of pollen grains and growth of pollen tubes -seed and cell wall formation -development and growth of new cells in meristematic tissue • Forms sugar/borate complexes associated with the translocation of sugars, starches, N, and P • Important in protein synthesis"
7,Copper,• Necessary for chlorophyll formation • Catalyzes several enzymes
8,Iron,• Serves as a catalyst in chlorophyll synthesis • Involved in many oxidation-reduction reactions during respiration and photosynthesis
9,Manganese,• Functions primarily as a part of the enzyme systems in plants • Serves as a catalyst in chlorophyll synthesis along with iron • Activates several important metabolic reactions (enzymes) • Plays a direct role in photosynthesis
10,Zinc,"• Aids in the synthesis of plant growth compounds and enzyme systems • Essential for promoting certain metabolic/enzymatic reactions • Necessary for the production of chlorophyll, carbohydrates, and growth hormones"
11,Molybdenum,• Required for the synthesis and activity of nitrate reductase; the enzyme system that reduces NO 3 - to NH 4 + in the plant • Essential in the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation by Rhizobia bacteria in legume root nodules
12,Chlorine,• Involved in: -energy reactions in the plant -breakdown of water -regulation of stomata guard cells -maintenance of turgor and rate of water loss -plant response to moisture stress and resistance to some diseases • Activates several enzyme systems
13,Cobalt,• Essential in the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation by Rhizobia bacteria in legume root nodules • Has not been proven to be essential for the growth of all higher plants
14,Nickel,• Component of the urease enzyme • Essential for plants supplied with urea and for those in which ureides are important in nitrogen metabolism
