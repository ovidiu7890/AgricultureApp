0,,,Wastewater treatment process,
1,Thickening,"Low force separation of water and solids by gravity, flotation, or cen- trifugation",Increase solids content by removing water,Lowers transportation costs.
2,,,Stabilization methods,
3,Digestion (anaerobic and/or aerobic),"Biological stabilization through con- version of organic matter to carbon dioxide, water, and methane","Reduces biological oxygen demand, pathogen density, and attractiveness of the material to vectors (disease- spreading organisms)",Reduces the quantity of biosolids.
4,Alkaline stabilization,"Stabilization through the addition of alkaline materials (e.g., lime, kiln dust).",Raises pH. Temporarily decreases biological activity. Reduces pathogen density and attractiveness of the material to vectors.,High pH immobilizes met- als as long as pH levels are maintained.
5,Heat Drying,Drying of biosolids by increasing temperature of solids during waste-,"Destroys pathogens, eliminates most of water.",Greatly reduces sludge volume.

7,,Chemical and physical processes that enhance the handling of stabilized biosolids,Chemical and physical processes that enhance the handling of stabilized biosolids,Chemical and physical processes that enhance the handling of stabilized biosolids
8,Conditioning,Processes that cause biosolids to coagulate to aid in the separation of water.,Improves sludge dewatering char- acteristics. May increase dry solids mass and improve stabilization.,The ease of spreading may be reduced by treating bio- solids with polymers.
9,Dewatering,"High force separation of water and solids. Methods include vacuum filters, centrifuges, filter and belt presses, etc.",Increase solids concentration to 15 to 45 %. Lowers N and K concentra- tions. Improves ease of handling.,Reduces land requirements and lowers transportation costs.
10,,,Advanced stabilization method,
11,Composting,"Aerobic, thermophilic, biological sta- bilization in a windrow, aerated static pile, or vessel.","Lowers biological activity, destroys most pathogens, and degrades sludge to humus-like material.",Excellent soil conditioning properties. Contains less plant available nitrogen than other biosolids.
