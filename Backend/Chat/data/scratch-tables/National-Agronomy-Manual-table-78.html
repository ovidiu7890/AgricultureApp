Proper nozzle spacing, boom height, and boom suspension, along with frequent calibration and replacement of worn nozzles and leaking tubing, can increase effi- cacy and reduce drift potential.</td></tr><tr><td>Substitution-cultural, mechanical or biological controls</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>Reduces risk-substituting alternative cultural, mechanical or biological pest suppression techniques to reduce the application of a pesticide that poses a hazard to an identified natural resource concern. Not applicable if hazards from alternative suppression techniques are not adequately managed.</td></tr><tr><td>Substitution-lower risk pesticides 2,3</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>Reduces risk-substituting an alternative lower risk pesticide to reduce the application of a pesticide that poses a hazard to an identified natural resource con- cern. Not applicable if the alternative pesticide is not explicitly recommended by extension or an appropri- ately certified crop consultant because NRCS cannot make pesticide recommendations.</td></tr><tr><td>Substitution-semio- chemicals</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>Reduces risk-using semiochemicals (e.g., mating disrupting pheromones) to decrease reproductive success or control population density/location to reduce pesticide applications.</td></tr></tbody></table>
