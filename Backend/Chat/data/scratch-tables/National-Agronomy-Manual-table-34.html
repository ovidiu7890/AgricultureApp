<table><tbody><tr><th>Essential element</th><th>Mobility</th><th>Deficiency symptoms and occurrence</th></tr><tr><td>Boron</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper leaves and the growing point show symptoms first</td><td>• Reduced leaf size and deformation of new leaves • Interveinal chlorosis if deficiency is severe deficiency • May cause distorted branches and stems • Related to flower and or fruit abortion, poor grain fill, and stunt- ed growth • May occur on very acid, sandy-textured soils or alkaline soils.</td></tr><tr><td>Copper</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper</td><td>• Reduced leaf size leaves and the growing point show • Uniformly pale yellow leaves deficiency symptoms first • Leaves may lack turgor and may develop a bluish-green cast, become chlorotic and curl • Flower production fails to take place • Organic soils are most likely to be Cu deficient</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first</td><td>• Interveinal chlorosis that progresses over the entire leaf • With severe deficiencies, leaves turn entirely white • Factors contributing to Fe deficiency include imbalance with other metals, excessive soil phosphorus levels, high soil pH, wet, and cold soils</td></tr><tr><td>Manganese</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first</td><td>• Interveinal chlorosis • Appearance of brownish-black specks • Occurs most often on high organic matter soils and soils with neutral to alkaline pH with low native Mn content</td></tr><tr><td>Zinc</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper leaves and the growing point show deficiency symptoms first</td><td>• Shortened internodes between new leaves • Death of meristematic tissue • Deformed new leaves • Interveinal chlorosis • Occurs most often on alkaline (high pH) soils or soils with high available phosphorus levels</td></tr><tr><td>Molybdenum</td><td>Not mobile within plants: upper leaves show deficiency symp- toms first</td><td>• Interveinal chlorosis • Wilting • Marginal necrosis of upper leaves • Occurs principally on very acid soils, since Mo becomes less available with low pH</td></tr><tr><td>Chlorine</td><td>Mobile within plant, but defi- ciency usually appear on the upper leaves first</td><td>• Chlorosis in upper leaves symptoms • Overall wilting of the plants • Deficiencies may occur in well drained soils under high rainfall conditions</td></tr><tr><td>Cobalt</td><td>Used by symbiotic N-fixing bac- teria in root nodules of legumes and other plants</td><td>• Causes nitrogen deficiency: chlorotic leaves and stunted plants • Occurs in areas with soils deficient in native Colorado</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel</td><td>Mobile within plants</td><td>• Symptoms and occurrence are not well documented but may in- clude chlorosis and necrosis in young leaves and failure to pro- duce viable seeds</td></tr></tbody></table>
