2,"Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen","Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen","• Directly involved in photosynthesis, which accounts for most of plant growth: 6CO 2 +12 H 2 O->6O 2 + 6 (CH 2 O) + 6 H 2 O"
3,Nitrogen,Nitrogen,"• Found in chlorophyll, nucleic acids, and amino acids • Component of protein and enzymes, which control almost all biological processes"
4,Phosphorus,Phosphorus,"• Typically concentrated in the seeds of many plants as phytin • Important for plant development including: -development of a healthy root system -normal seed development -uniform crop maturation -photosynthesis, respiration, cell division, and other processes • Essential component of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is directly responsible for energy transfer reactions in the plant Essential component of DNA and RNA, and phospholipids, which play critical roles in cell membranes"
5,Potassium,Potassium,"• Found in ionic form in the cell, rather than incorporated in structure of organic compounds • Responsible for: -regulation of water usage in plants -disease resistance -stem strength • Involved in: - photosynthesis -drought tolerance -improved winter-hardiness -protein synthesis • Linked to improvement of overall crop quality, including handling and storage quality"
