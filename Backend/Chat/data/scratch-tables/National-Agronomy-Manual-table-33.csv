,Essential element,Mobility,Deficiency symptoms and occurrence
0,Nitrogen,Mobile within plants: lower leaves,"• Stunted, slow growing, chlorotic plants show chlorosis first • Reduced yield • Plants more susceptible to weather stress and disease • Some crops may mature earlier"
1,Phosphorus,Mobile within plants: lower leaves,• Over-all stunted plant and a poorly developed root system show deficiency first • Can cause purple or reddish color associated with the accumula- tion of sugars • Difficult to detect in field
2,Potassium,Mobile within plants: lower leaves,"• Commonly causes scorching or firing along leaf margins show deficiency first • Deficient plants grow slowly, have poorly-developed root systems, weak stalks; lodging is common • Seed and fruit are small and shriveled • Plants possess low resistance to disease • Deficiencies most common on acid sandy soils and soils that have received large applications of Ca and/or Mg"
3,Calcium,Not mobile within plants: upper leaves and the growing point show deficiency symp- toms first,"• Poor root growth: Ca deficient roots often turn black and rot • Failure of terminal buds of shoots and apical tips of roots to de- velop, causing plant growth to cease • Most often occurs on very acid soils where Ca levels are low • Other deficiency effects such as high acidity usually limit growth before Ca deficiency apparent"
4,Magnesium,Mobile within plants: lower leaves,"• Leaves show a yellowish, bronze or reddish color while leaf show deficiency first veins remain green"
5,Sulfur,Somewhat mobile within plants but upper leaves tend to show deficiency first,"• Chlorosis of the longer leaves • If deficiency is severe, entire plant can be chlorotic and stunted • Symptoms resemble those of nitrogen deficiency; can lead to incor- rect diagnoses"
